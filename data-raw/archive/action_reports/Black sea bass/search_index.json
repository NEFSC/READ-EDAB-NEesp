All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 1.2.1 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 1.2.2 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series. "],["risk-assessment.html", "1.3 Risk assessment", " 1.3 Risk assessment 1.3.1 Risk across stocks 1.3.1.1 Suite of indicators All stocks were ranked in order of increasing risk. The stock with the highest ranking is the stock determined to be at the highest risk. In this case, high risk has two meanings: (1) high importance (e.g., a stock with a high catch would have a high risk ranking for the catch indicator) or high vulnerability (e.g., a stock with low B/Bmsy would have a high risk ranking for the B/Bmsy indicator). The normalized rank was determined by dividing each stocks rank by the total number of stocks considered for that indicator. Stocks that were missing indicator measurements were assigned a normalized rank of 0.5. 1.3.1.2 Individual indicators Risk was calculated over time for all indicators that were documented for five or more species in a given year. Risk was calculated as the average of the past 5 years, as a percent of the historical average. The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of this species compared to all other species in that year. 1.3.2 Risk within stocks The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of each yearly measurement compared to all other years.

Figure 2.1: Black sea bass distribution 2.1.2 Latitude and longitude ranges Latitude and longitude ranges were calculated from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata and Bottom Trawl Survey (BTS) shapefiles. The coordinate system is WGS84. Using fisheries independent data from bottom trawls in survdat. Several metrics of distribution in observed catches are calculated. Changes in distribution can indicate changes in the geographic range of a species due to a variety of constraints such as food availability or physiologic limitations.The unweighted centroid is one metric that describes the geometric center of the observed range of Black sea bass in a given year. Calculated as the mean of latitude and longitude of all tows that captured the species of interest.The density of observations for Black sea bass was visualized using two-dimensional kernel density estimation on a grid as documented in MASS::kde2d. This density estimation is then visualized to indicate areas of greater or lesser probability of occurrence 2.1.3 Figures 2.1.3.1 Density and distribution estimation by season 2.1.3.2 Centroid of observations The average position of observations across all years of surveys "],["population-information.html", "3 Population information", " 3 Population information "],["abundance.html", "3.1 Abundance", " 3.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 3.1.1 Survey abundance (raw measurements) Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.
