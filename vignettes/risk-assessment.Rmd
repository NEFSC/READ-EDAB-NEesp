## What is risk assessment?

Risk assessment is a structured method to identify issues of concern, which can be used to systematically identify and prioritize action items. Therefore, risk assessment is a useful first step to approach decision making in fisheries management, and it [has been used](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00442/full) by the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council to prioritize research plans for an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. In approaching the preliminary Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) for Northeast stocks, we conducted a risk assessment to determine which stocks would benefit most from an ESP. This risk assessment involved aggregating existing data about stock ecology and socioeconomics and determining whether indicators were trending favorably or unfavorably for each stock.

## The NRCC risk assessment

The (Northeast Region Coordinating Council (NRCC))[https://www.nefmc.org/committees/northeast-regional-coordinating-council-nrcc] is the organizational body responsible for setting the stock assessment schedule in the Northeast. In 2016-2017, the NRCC developed a (risk assessment process)[https://s3.amazonaws.com/nefmc.org/Stock-assessment-process-June2020.pdf] to inform the setting of (research and management track stock assessment schedules)[https://www.nefmc.org/library/2020-2024-stock-assessment-schedule].

## Adding to the risk assessment

The goals of the ESP (providing ecosystem and socioeconomic advice for stock management) differ from the goals of the NRCC (setting the stock assessment schedule). Therefore, we conducted our (own risk assessment)[https://noaa-edab.github.io/ESP_docs/risk_ranking/plot_all_risk] to determine which stocks would benefit most from an ESP. As part of our risk assessment, we identified which stocks were of most socioeconomic importance and which stocks exhibited concerning ecosystem and socioeconomic trends. Stocks were ranked from least concern to most concern for each indicator, and then ranks were normalized. If a stock was missing a measurement, it was assigned a normalized rank of 0.5. The total risk for each stock was calculated as the sum of all normalized rankings. 

This risk assessment is intended to be a guideline for ESP prioritization, not a rigid directive for ESP scheduling.
