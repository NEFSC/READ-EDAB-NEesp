The [summary report](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/NEesp/tree/dev/inst/summary_esp_template) can be created by the [`NEespShiny` app](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/NEespShiny); there is no wrapper R function to render this report at this time.

## The intro file

The [intro file](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/NEesp/blob/dev/inst/summary_esp_template/intro.Rmd) contains important set-up information for the report. Report specifications, including parameters, are defined in the YAML frontmatter. However, no data is read in at this step.

## The child file

The [child file](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/NEesp/blob/dev/inst/summary_esp_template/child.Rmd) is knit for each indicator of interest. Variables values are specified by the shiny app. The [`wrap_analysis` function](https://noaa-edab.github.io/NEesp/reference/wrap_analysis.html) plots the data and adds report card information to a report card object that will be displayed at the end of the report. 

## The end file

The [end file](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/NEesp/blob/dev/inst/summary_esp_template/end.Rmd) displays the ESP report cards and appendix.
