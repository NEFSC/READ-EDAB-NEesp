Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: White hake 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: White hake 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.012 +- 0.019 () 0 - 0.078 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.015 +- 0.024 () 0.001 - 0.081 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.025 +- 0.083 () 0 - 0.517 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.017 +- 0.026 () 0 - 0.085 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.006 +- 0.006 () 0.001 - 0.017 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.022 +- 0.016 () 0.006 - 0.046 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.001 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.008 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.008 +- 0.019 () 0 - 0.072 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.002 +- 0.003 () 0 - 0.015 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0.011 +- 0.01 () 0 - 0.027 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.001 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.003 +- 0.002 () 0.001 - 0.005 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.102 +- 0.092 () 0.011 - 0.413 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.194 +- 0.207 () 0.011 - 0.823 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.118 +- 0.143 () 0.007 - 0.788 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.134 +- 0.1 () 0.018 - 0.335 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.199 +- 0.078 () 0.086 - 0.29 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.592 +- 0.305 () 0.178 - 0.879 FISH FALL all 0.858 +- 0.116 () 0.487 - 0.988 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.757 +- 0.228 () 0.099 - 0.989 FISH SPRING all 0.847 +- 0.174 () 0.09 - 0.993 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.827 +- 0.126 () 0.586 - 0.978 FISH SUMMER all 0.742 +- 0.148 () 0.462 - 0.871 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.383 +- 0.291 () 0.097 - 0.77 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.034 +- 0.042 () 0 - 0.165 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.036 +- 0.053 () 0 - 0.196 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.012 +- 0.021 () 0 - 0.103 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.026 +- 0.033 () 0 - 0.107 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.053 +- 0.098 () 0 - 0.251 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.003 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.005 OTHER FALL all 0.002 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.032 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.009 +- 0.016 () 0 - 0.061 OTHER SPRING all 0.003 +- 0.011 () 0 - 0.051 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.003 +- 0.005 () 0 - 0.011 OTHER SUMMER all 0 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0 +- 0 () 0 - 0 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)White hake "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
