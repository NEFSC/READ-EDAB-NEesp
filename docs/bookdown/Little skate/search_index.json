This report is pulling information on all Northeast Little skate stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Little skate 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

(#fig:laurel_cond_data)Little skate 4.3 Diet Diet data were compiled from existing data. For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: Little skate 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.103 +- 0.051 () 0.009 - 0.234 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.078 +- 0.061 () 0.008 - 0.221 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.105 +- 0.052 () 0.014 - 0.217 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.087 +- 0.053 () 0.004 - 0.204 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.09 +- 0.034 () 0.042 - 0.12 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.128 +- 0.041 () 0.099 - 0.157 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER all 0.129 +- 0.044 () 0.053 - 0.211 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.152 +- 0.049 () 0.068 - 0.264 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.104 +- 0.061 () 0.007 - 0.295 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.126 +- 0.042 () 0.061 - 0.263 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0.084 +- 0.056 () 0.001 - 0.238 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.204 +- 0.109 () 0.099 - 0.302 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.249 +- 0.146 () 0.146 - 0.353 ANNELIDA WINTER all 0.115 +- 0.035 () 0.069 - 0.201 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.57 +- 0.074 () 0.426 - 0.759 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.607 +- 0.14 () 0.349 - 0.847 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.61 +- 0.064 () 0.497 - 0.754 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.605 +- 0.133 () 0.355 - 0.883 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.551 +- 0.138 () 0.36 - 0.665 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.401 +- 0.266 () 0.213 - 0.59 ARTHROPODA WINTER all 0.528 +- 0.083 () 0.349 - 0.65 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.004 +- 0.012 () 0 - 0.056 CNIDARIA FALL Outside stock area 0.003 +- 0 () 0.003 - 0.004 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.003 +- 0.004 () 0 - 0.015 CNIDARIA SPRING Outside stock area 0.005 +- 0.004 () 0 - 0.01 CNIDARIA SUMMER all 0.007 +- 0.001 () 0.007 - 0.008 CNIDARIA WINTER all 0.002 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.005 FISH FALL all 0.113 +- 0.067 () 0.008 - 0.269 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.155 +- 0.12 () 0.011 - 0.408 FISH SPRING all 0.083 +- 0.046 () 0.013 - 0.198 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.079 +- 0.057 () 0.009 - 0.22 FISH SUMMER all 0.077 +- 0.072 () 0.009 - 0.177 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.204 +- 0.094 () 0.137 - 0.27 FISH WINTER all 0.139 +- 0.072 () 0.034 - 0.268 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.052 +- 0.038 () 0.005 - 0.207 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.066 +- 0.083 () 0.011 - 0.332 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.066 +- 0.034 () 0.002 - 0.166 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.151 +- 0.13 () 0.023 - 0.632 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.069 +- 0.04 () 0.03 - 0.114 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.018 +- 0.014 () 0.008 - 0.028 MOLLUSCA WINTER all 0.085 +- 0.03 () 0.034 - 0.14 OTHER FALL all 0.007 +- 0.007 () 0 - 0.032 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.012 +- 0.009 () 0.001 - 0.023 OTHER SPRING all 0.007 +- 0.01 () 0 - 0.043 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.002 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.006 OTHER SUMMER all 0.007 +- 0.011 () 0 - 0.02 OTHER WINTER all 0.003 +- 0.003 () 0 - 0.007 WORMS FALL all 0.002 +- 0.003 () 0 - 0.011 WORMS FALL Outside stock area 0.02 +- NA () 0.02 - 0.02 WORMS SPRING all 0.005 +- 0.015 () 0 - 0.074 WORMS SPRING Outside stock area 0.002 +- 0.001 () 0 - 0.004 WORMS SUMMER all 0.001 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 WORMS WINTER all 0 +- 0 () 0 - 0 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Little skate "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
