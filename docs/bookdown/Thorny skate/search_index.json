Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

Figure 3.1: Thorny skate 3.3 Temperature Surface and bottom temperature data were pulled from survdat. 3.3.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Thorny skate 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: Thorny skate 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.045 +- 0.037 () 0.001 - 0.185 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.06 +- 0.049 () 0 - 0.186 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.033 +- 0.032 () 0.005 - 0.087 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.005 +- NA () 0.005 - 0.005 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.242 +- 0.101 () 0.105 - 0.479 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.25 +- 0.117 () 0.084 - 0.471 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.281 +- 0.144 () 0.031 - 0.399 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.276 +- NA () 0.276 - 0.276 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.234 +- 0.13 () 0.069 - 0.616 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.273 +- 0.147 () 0.059 - 0.61 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.097 +- 0.063 () 0.033 - 0.2 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.659 +- NA () 0.659 - 0.659 FISH FALL all 0.418 +- 0.18 () 0.046 - 0.692 FISH SPRING all 0.363 +- 0.204 () 0.038 - 0.751 FISH SUMMER all 0.503 +- 0.082 () 0.388 - 0.612 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.059 +- NA () 0.059 - 0.059 MISCELLANEOUS FALL all 0.01 +- 0.018 () 0 - 0.054 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING all 0.004 +- 0.004 () 0 - 0.011 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER all 0.008 +- NA () 0.008 - 0.008 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.056 +- 0.061 () 0.001 - 0.319 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.051 +- 0.056 () 0.002 - 0.205 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.079 +- 0.115 () 0.001 - 0.28 OTHER FALL all 0.005 +- 0.005 () 0 - 0.022 OTHER SPRING all 0.013 +- 0.018 () 0 - 0.073 OTHER SUMMER all 0.007 +- 0.007 () 0 - 0.015 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Thorny skate "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
