<p>Diet data were compiled from <a href="https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition/blob/master/data/allfh.RData">existing data</a>. For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predator’s diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the “other” category.</p>
