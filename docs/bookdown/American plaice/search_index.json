Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: American plaice 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: American plaice 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.097 +- 0.084 () 0.002 - 0.294 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.019 +- 0.02 () 0.001 - 0.04 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.057 +- 0.043 () 0.001 - 0.18 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.154 +- 0.16 () 0.003 - 0.512 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.274 +- NA () 0.274 - 0.274 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.04 +- 0.045 () 0.003 - 0.201 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.061 +- 0.041 () 0.018 - 0.118 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.073 +- 0.079 () 0.003 - 0.308 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0.235 +- 0.18 () 0.014 - 0.527 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.003 +- NA () 0.003 - 0.003 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.093 +- 0.096 () 0.004 - 0.352 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.214 +- 0.208 () 0.011 - 0.501 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.136 +- 0.147 () 0.006 - 0.568 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.154 +- 0.152 () 0.011 - 0.426 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.014 +- NA () 0.014 - 0.014 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.002 +- 0.002 () 0.001 - 0.005 CNIDARIA FALL Outside stock area 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.035 +- 0.036 () 0.001 - 0.133 CNIDARIA SPRING Outside stock area 0.046 +- 0.039 () 0.014 - 0.09 ECHINODERMATA FALL all 0.702 +- 0.159 () 0.395 - 0.938 ECHINODERMATA FALL Outside stock area 0.573 +- 0.106 () 0.431 - 0.655 ECHINODERMATA SPRING all 0.638 +- 0.185 () 0.011 - 0.886 ECHINODERMATA SPRING Outside stock area 0.29 +- 0.352 () 0.018 - 0.855 ECHINODERMATA SUMMER all 0.454 +- NA () 0.454 - 0.454 FISH FALL all 0.04 +- 0.045 () 0 - 0.152 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.008 +- 0.006 () 0.002 - 0.013 FISH SPRING all 0.025 +- 0.031 () 0 - 0.083 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.018 +- 0.024 () 0.001 - 0.035 MISCELLANEOUS FALL all 0.029 +- 0.043 () 0 - 0.153 MISCELLANEOUS FALL Outside stock area 0.063 +- 0.089 () 0 - 0.126 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING all 0.023 +- 0.036 () 0.001 - 0.136 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING Outside stock area 0.059 +- 0.075 () 0.001 - 0.175 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER all 0.027 +- NA () 0.027 - 0.027 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.023 +- 0.032 () 0 - 0.114 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.088 +- 0.114 () 0.006 - 0.257 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.045 +- 0.048 () 0.002 - 0.211 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.146 +- 0.144 () 0 - 0.392 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.228 +- NA () 0.228 - 0.228 OTHER FALL all 0.001 +- 0.001 () 0 - 0.004 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.008 +- 0.011 () 0 - 0.021 OTHER SPRING all 0.007 +- 0.01 () 0 - 0.035 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 OTHER SUMMER all 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 UROCHORDATA SPRING all 0.068 +- NA () 0.068 - 0.068 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)American plaice "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
