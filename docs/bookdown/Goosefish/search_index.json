Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Goosefish 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: Goosefish 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.011 +- 0.033 () 0 - 0.144 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.011 +- 0.017 () 0 - 0.067 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.006 +- 0.012 () 0 - 0.046 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.009 +- 0.009 () 0 - 0.022 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.044 +- 0.051 () 0.014 - 0.103 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.007 +- NA () 0.007 - 0.007 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.017 +- 0.025 () 0 - 0.078 ARTHROPODA FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.005 +- 0.005 () 0 - 0.022 ARTHROPODA FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.002 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.007 ARTHROPODA SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.008 +- 0.007 () 0 - 0.02 ARTHROPODA SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.004 +- 0.007 () 0 - 0.021 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.027 +- 0.039 () 0.003 - 0.085 ARTHROPODA WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.001 +- 0.001 () 0 - 0.002 FISH FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.919 +- 0.179 () 0.158 - 0.999 FISH FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.758 +- 0.173 () 0.416 - 0.966 FISH SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.98 +- 0.024 () 0.911 - 0.999 FISH SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.957 +- 0.035 () 0.854 - 0.994 FISH SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.936 +- 0.049 () 0.888 - 0.989 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.967 +- NA () 0.967 - 0.967 FISH WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.923 +- 0.045 () 0.841 - 0.997 MOLLUSCA FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.104 +- 0.222 () 0.001 - 0.84 MOLLUSCA FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.23 +- 0.176 () 0.006 - 0.574 MOLLUSCA SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.015 +- 0.031 () 0 - 0.086 MOLLUSCA SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.029 +- 0.026 () 0 - 0.102 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.023 +- NA () 0.023 - 0.023 MOLLUSCA WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.061 +- 0.039 () 0.019 - 0.145 OTHER FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.006 +- 0.013 () 0 - 0.045 OTHER FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.002 +- 0.003 () 0 - 0.008 OTHER SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.002 +- 0.005 () 0 - 0.016 OTHER SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.009 +- 0.014 () 0 - 0.043 OTHER SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 0.014 +- NA () 0.014 - 0.014 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 OTHER WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 0.004 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.023 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Goosefish "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
