This report is pulling information on all Northeast Goosefish stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

Please note, only fall and spring strata are shown on the map. 3.2 Latitude and longitude ranges Latitude and longitude ranges were calculated from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata and Bottom Trawl Survey (BTS) shapefiles. The coordinate system is WGS84. 3.3 Temperature Surface and bottom temperature data were pulled from survdat. 3.3.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. 3.3.2 Summary 3.3.3 Data 3.4 Salinity Surface and bottom salinity data were pulled from survdat. 3.4.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines.

Only years with more than 10 fish lengths were considered for analysis. 4.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for the minimum, mean, and maximum lengths; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than three trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. 4.1.2 Summary Season Region Mean value +- SD (n fish, n years) Mean value +- SD (n fish, past 5 years) Range (total) Range (past 5 years) FALL Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 37.9 +- 22.75 (9,421, 57) 33.64 +- 19.66 (4,185, 5) 5 - 121 5 - 95 FALL Outside stock area 34.99 +- 24.02 (841, 24) 23.82 +- 12.12 (387, 5) 3 - 108 6 - 95 FALL Southern Georges Bank / Mid 33.95 +- 18.24 (10,846, 57) 28.47 +- 14.02 (4,005, 5) 3 - 109 5 - 90 SPRING Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 42.92 +- 20.56 (6,269, 52) 41.31 +- 16.39 (2,256, 5) 8 - 121 8 - 109 SPRING Outside stock area 48.76 +- 28.13 (1,451, 26) 25.46 +- 13.78 (282, 5) 6 - 116 8 - 106 SPRING Southern Georges Bank / Mid 45.01 +- 17.4 (9,123, 53) 40.38 +- 13.58 (2,513, 5) 7 - 124 7 - 103 SUMMER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 33.66 +- 16.04 (187, 3) 33.66 +- 16.04 (187, 3) 11 - 101 11 - 101 WINTER Gulf of Maine / Northern Georges Bank 44.91 +- 14.33 (11, 1) 44.91 +- 14.33 (11, 1) 15 - 66 15 - 66 WINTER Outside stock area 24.89 +- 8.44 (27, 1) 24.89 +- 8.44 (27, 1) 12 - 60 12 - 60 WINTER Southern Georges Bank / Mid 42.71 +- 12.61 (8,247, 15) 45.41 +- 12.66 (3,482, 5) 8 - 101 12 - 92 4.1.3 Data 4.2 Condition Condition information comes from diet data; only regions and seasons with more than 10 fish observations were considered. We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. 4.2.1.3 Condition factor: Relative weight Please note, this data is aggregated by Ecological Protection Unit (EPU), which may differ slightly from the stock assessment regions. 4.2.2 Data 4.2.2.1 Length vs weight with weight-volume condition factor 4.2.2.2 Relative weight condition factor Please note, this data is aggregated by Ecological Protection Unit (EPU), which may differ slightly from the stock assessment regions.

A high rank number and a normalized rank near 1 indicates that the species is at risk or of importance based on the measured indicator values.
