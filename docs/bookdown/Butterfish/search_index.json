This report is pulling information on all Northeast Butterfish stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Butterfish 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

(#fig:laurel_cond_data)Butterfish 4.3 Diet Diet data were compiled from existing data. For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: Butterfish 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.574 +- 0.243 () 0.147 - 0.918 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.58 +- 0.306 () 0.011 - 0.974 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.547 +- 0.228 () 0.21 - 0.991 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.275 +- 0.026 () 0.257 - 0.293 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.704 +- 0.244 () 0.44 - 0.922 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.91 +- 0.121 () 0.772 - 1 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER all 0.761 +- 0.154 () 0.56 - 0.918 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.033 +- 0.073 () 0.001 - 0.296 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.006 +- 0.006 () 0.003 - 0.013 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.059 +- 0.124 () 0.001 - 0.28 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0 +- NA () 0 - 0 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.395 +- NA () 0.395 - 0.395 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.077 +- 0.108 () 0.001 - 0.153 ANNELIDA WINTER all 0.01 +- 0.002 () 0.009 - 0.011 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.087 +- 0.07 () 0.002 - 0.231 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.067 +- 0.078 () 0.005 - 0.289 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.142 +- 0.123 () 0.002 - 0.446 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.117 +- 0.165 () 0.001 - 0.234 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.165 +- NA () 0.165 - 0.165 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.035 +- 0.046 () 0.002 - 0.068 ARTHROPODA WINTER all 0.188 +- 0.145 () 0.057 - 0.407 CHAETOGNATHA FALL all 0.02 +- 0.03 () 0.002 - 0.065 CHAETOGNATHA SPRING all 0.009 +- 0.011 () 0.002 - 0.017 CHAETOGNATHA SUMMER all 0.068 +- NA () 0.068 - 0.068 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.116 +- 0.136 () 0.004 - 0.373 CNIDARIA FALL Outside stock area 0.068 +- 0.066 () 0.006 - 0.17 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.097 +- 0.092 () 0.041 - 0.203 CNIDARIA SUMMER all 0.162 +- NA () 0.162 - 0.162 CNIDARIA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 CNIDARIA WINTER all 0.021 +- NA () 0.021 - 0.021 CTENOPHORA FALL all 0.118 +- 0.155 () 0.004 - 0.61 CTENOPHORA FALL Outside stock area 0.271 +- 0.206 () 0.037 - 0.654 CTENOPHORA SPRING all 0.124 +- 0.101 () 0.004 - 0.322 CTENOPHORA SPRING Outside stock area 0.117 +- NA () 0.117 - 0.117 CTENOPHORA SUMMER all 0.023 +- NA () 0.023 - 0.023 CTENOPHORA WINTER all 0.025 +- 0.017 () 0.008 - 0.049 FISH FALL all 0.013 +- 0.033 () 0 - 0.105 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.03 +- 0.012 () 0.013 - 0.041 FISH SPRING all 0.013 +- 0.015 () 0.002 - 0.039 FISH SUMMER all 0.013 +- NA () 0.013 - 0.013 FISH WINTER all 0.054 +- NA () 0.054 - 0.054 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.146 +- 0.254 () 0.002 - 0.683 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.468 +- 0.654 () 0.006 - 0.93 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.059 +- 0.056 () 0.001 - 0.122 MOLLUSCA WINTER all 0.082 +- NA () 0.082 - 0.082 OTHER FALL all 0.25 +- 0.22 () 0.003 - 0.583 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.335 +- 0.258 () 0.017 - 0.767 OTHER SPRING all 0.235 +- 0.253 () 0.003 - 0.776 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.393 +- NA () 0.393 - 0.393 UNOBS FALL all 0.062 +- NA () 0.062 - 0.062 UROCHORDATA FALL all 0.082 +- 0.089 () 0.01 - 0.32 UROCHORDATA FALL Outside stock area 0.078 +- 0.049 () 0.03 - 0.142 UROCHORDATA SPRING all 0.178 +- 0.267 () 0.001 - 0.74 UROCHORDATA SPRING Outside stock area 0.704 +- NA () 0.704 - 0.704 UROCHORDATA SUMMER all 0.031 +- 0.029 () 0.011 - 0.052 UROCHORDATA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.036 +- NA () 0.036 - 0.036 UROCHORDATA WINTER all 0.025 +- NA () 0.025 - 0.025 WORMS FALL all 0.018 +- 0.02 () 0.002 - 0.054 WORMS FALL Outside stock area 0.005 +- NA () 0.005 - 0.005 WORMS SPRING all 0.021 +- NA () 0.021 - 0.021 WORMS SPRING Outside stock area 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 WORMS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.007 +- NA () 0.007 - 0.007 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Butterfish "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
