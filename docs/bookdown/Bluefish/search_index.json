This report is pulling information on all Northeast Bluefish stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

Figure 3.1: Bluefish 3.3 Temperature Surface and bottom temperature data were pulled from survdat. 3.3.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.4: Bluefish 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.6: Bluefish 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.014 +- 0.04 () 0 - 0.172 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.004 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.027 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0 +- NA () 0 - 0 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.032 +- 0.037 () 0.001 - 0.084 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.004 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.002 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.011 +- 0.011 () 0.001 - 0.045 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.008 +- 0.013 () 0 - 0.06 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.039 +- NA () 0.039 - 0.039 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.013 +- 0.008 () 0.007 - 0.019 FISH FALL all 0.803 +- 0.132 () 0.491 - 0.996 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.82 +- 0.153 () 0.342 - 0.99 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.665 +- NA () 0.665 - 0.665 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.827 +- 0.221 () 0.571 - 0.957 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.166 +- 0.12 () 0.003 - 0.422 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.167 +- 0.154 () 0.007 - 0.651 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.296 +- NA () 0.296 - 0.296 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.164 +- 0.229 () 0.026 - 0.429 OTHER FALL all 0.009 +- 0.009 () 0 - 0.026 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.005 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.022 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Bluefish "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
