This report is pulling information on all Northeast Pollock stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

Figure 3.1: Pollock 3.3 Temperature Surface and bottom temperature data were pulled from survdat. 3.3.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.4: Pollock 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.6: Pollock 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.032 +- 0.033 () 0.001 - 0.159 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.039 +- 0.055 () 0.009 - 0.136 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.021 +- 0.028 () 0 - 0.11 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.025 +- 0.02 () 0.004 - 0.056 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.006 +- 0.008 () 0 - 0.012 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.005 +- NA () 0.005 - 0.005 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.328 +- 0.195 () 0.024 - 0.713 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.69 +- 0.4 () 0.052 - 1 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.494 +- 0.274 () 0.03 - 0.95 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.446 +- 0.102 () 0.28 - 0.582 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.006 +- 0.002 () 0.005 - 0.008 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.029 +- NA () 0.029 - 0.029 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.027 +- 0.059 () 0 - 0.133 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.001 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 CNIDARIA SPRING Outside stock area 0 +- NA () 0 - 0 CTENOPHORA FALL all 0.03 +- 0.048 () 0.001 - 0.135 CTENOPHORA FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 CTENOPHORA SPRING all 0.013 +- 0.017 () 0 - 0.054 CTENOPHORA SPRING Outside stock area 0.009 +- NA () 0.009 - 0.009 FISH FALL all 0.57 +- 0.214 () 0.005 - 0.955 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.319 +- 0.329 () 0.029 - 0.645 FISH SPRING all 0.456 +- 0.264 () 0.029 - 0.963 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.521 +- 0.118 () 0.345 - 0.69 FISH SUMMER all 0.985 +- 0.008 () 0.98 - 0.991 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.966 +- NA () 0.966 - 0.966 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.074 +- 0.165 () 0 - 0.794 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.128 +- 0.123 () 0.007 - 0.252 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.036 +- 0.058 () 0 - 0.219 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.006 +- 0.004 () 0.001 - 0.01 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 OTHER FALL all 0.008 +- 0.01 () 0 - 0.031 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.004 +- NA () 0.004 - 0.004 OTHER SPRING all 0.007 +- 0.014 () 0 - 0.06 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.003 +- 0.003 () 0.001 - 0.009 OTHER SUMMER all 0.003 +- NA () 0.003 - 0.003 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Pollock "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
