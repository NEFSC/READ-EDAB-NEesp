This report is pulling information on all Northeast Yellowtail flounder stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Yellowtail flounder 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.
