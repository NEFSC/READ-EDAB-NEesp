This report is pulling information on all Northeast Smooth dogfish stocks. "],["methods.html", "Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods 2.2 assessmentdata methods 2.3 survdat methods", " Section 2 Methods 2.1 General methods Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.4: Smooth dogfish 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.6: Smooth dogfish 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.023 +- 0.019 () 0.001 - 0.073 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.049 +- 0.041 () 0.001 - 0.155 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.07 +- 0.054 () 0.005 - 0.198 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.06 +- 0.048 () 0.021 - 0.148 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.04 +- 0.008 () 0.035 - 0.049 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER all 0.078 +- 0.093 () 0.003 - 0.324 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.007 +- 0.006 () 0.001 - 0.028 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.017 +- 0.018 () 0.003 - 0.086 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.015 +- 0.011 () 0.001 - 0.041 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0.015 +- 0.014 () 0.003 - 0.037 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.007 +- 0.003 () 0.004 - 0.009 ANNELIDA WINTER all 0.019 +- 0.022 () 0.003 - 0.076 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.763 +- 0.112 () 0.536 - 0.956 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.716 +- 0.117 () 0.465 - 0.915 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.495 +- 0.163 () 0.245 - 0.851 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.551 +- 0.168 () 0.227 - 0.698 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.785 +- 0.039 () 0.76 - 0.83 ARTHROPODA WINTER all 0.524 +- 0.163 () 0.29 - 0.768 BRYOZOA FALL all 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 BRYOZOA WINTER all 0.053 +- NA () 0.053 - 0.053 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.01 +- 0.025 () 0 - 0.096 CNIDARIA FALL Outside stock area 0.011 +- 0.018 () 0 - 0.041 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.004 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.008 CNIDARIA SPRING Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 CNIDARIA WINTER all 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 ECHINODERMATA FALL all 0.001 +- 0.001 () 0 - 0.003 ECHINODERMATA FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0.001 () 0 - 0.003 ECHINODERMATA SPRING all 0.014 +- 0.031 () 0 - 0.084 ECHINODERMATA WINTER all 0.004 +- 0.003 () 0.001 - 0.007 FISH FALL all 0.094 +- 0.081 () 0.01 - 0.35 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.07 +- 0.059 () 0.002 - 0.246 FISH SPRING all 0.172 +- 0.116 () 0.011 - 0.489 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.339 +- 0.148 () 0.186 - 0.609 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.058 +- 0.05 () 0.014 - 0.111 FISH WINTER all 0.194 +- 0.123 () 0.072 - 0.456 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.108 +- 0.068 () 0.023 - 0.325 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.143 +- 0.108 () 0.007 - 0.449 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.237 +- 0.177 () 0.004 - 0.629 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.039 +- 0.056 () 0.001 - 0.168 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.109 +- 0.058 () 0.062 - 0.174 MOLLUSCA WINTER all 0.178 +- 0.139 () 0.003 - 0.436 OTHER FALL all 0.004 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.023 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.007 +- 0.011 () 0.001 - 0.036 OTHER SPRING all 0.014 +- 0.02 () 0 - 0.065 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.002 +- 0.001 () 0.001 - 0.003 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.003 OTHER WINTER all 0.003 +- 0.001 () 0.002 - 0.005 WORMS FALL all 0.002 +- 0.002 () 0 - 0.005 WORMS FALL Outside stock area 0.013 +- 0.022 () 0 - 0.053 WORMS SPRING all 0.012 +- 0.019 () 0 - 0.034 WORMS SPRING Outside stock area 0.011 +- 0.013 () 0 - 0.032 WORMS WINTER all 0.002 +- 0.001 () 0.002 - 0.003 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Smooth dogfish "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
