Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.4: Black sea bass 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.6: Black sea bass 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.033 +- 0.032 () 0.004 - 0.126 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.003 +- NA () 0.003 - 0.003 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.101 +- 0.098 () 0 - 0.334 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.013 +- NA () 0.013 - 0.013 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.007 +- 0.005 () 0.004 - 0.01 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER all 0.091 +- 0.055 () 0.03 - 0.16 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.071 +- 0.078 () 0.002 - 0.316 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.042 +- 0.063 () 0 - 0.179 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.014 +- NA () 0.014 - 0.014 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0 +- 0 () 0 - 0.001 ANNELIDA WINTER all 0.115 +- 0.057 () 0.04 - 0.196 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.606 +- 0.175 () 0.347 - 0.932 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.6 +- NA () 0.6 - 0.6 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.524 +- 0.211 () 0.261 - 0.819 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.965 +- NA () 0.965 - 0.965 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.257 +- 0.101 () 0.186 - 0.328 ARTHROPODA WINTER all 0.449 +- 0.085 () 0.318 - 0.554 CHORDATA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.077 +- NA () 0.077 - 0.077 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.014 +- 0.017 () 0 - 0.048 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.033 +- 0.031 () 0.005 - 0.062 CNIDARIA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.013 +- NA () 0.013 - 0.013 CNIDARIA WINTER all 0.093 +- 0.102 () 0.02 - 0.165 ECHINODERMATA FALL all 0.009 +- 0.012 () 0.002 - 0.03 ECHINODERMATA SPRING all 0.04 +- 0.061 () 0 - 0.192 ECHINODERMATA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.008 +- 0.01 () 0.001 - 0.014 ECHINODERMATA WINTER all 0.004 +- 0.002 () 0.002 - 0.006 FISH FALL all 0.158 +- 0.102 () 0.017 - 0.355 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.147 +- NA () 0.147 - 0.147 FISH SPRING all 0.168 +- 0.219 () 0.006 - 0.657 FISH SUMMER all 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0.436 +- 0.275 () 0.242 - 0.63 FISH WINTER all 0.149 +- 0.093 () 0.046 - 0.294 MISCELLANEOUS FALL all 0.014 +- 0.016 () 0.001 - 0.051 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING all 0.008 +- 0.006 () 0 - 0.016 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER all 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.009 +- 0.002 () 0.008 - 0.011 MISCELLANEOUS WINTER all 0.002 +- NA () 0.002 - 0.002 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.131 +- 0.1 () 0.004 - 0.407 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.248 +- NA () 0.248 - 0.248 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.146 +- 0.103 () 0.076 - 0.402 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.006 +- NA () 0.006 - 0.006 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.235 +- 0.107 () 0.16 - 0.311 MOLLUSCA WINTER all 0.143 +- 0.081 () 0.037 - 0.221 OTHER FALL all 0.012 +- 0.013 () 0 - 0.045 OTHER FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 OTHER SPRING all 0.038 +- 0.058 () 0.001 - 0.159 OTHER SUMMER Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0 () 0.001 - 0.002 OTHER WINTER all 0.009 +- 0.01 () 0.002 - 0.016 UROCHORDATA FALL all 0.011 +- 0.005 () 0.007 - 0.014 UROCHORDATA SPRING all 0.067 +- 0.041 () 0.038 - 0.095 UROCHORDATA WINTER all 0.032 +- 0.031 () 0.01 - 0.067 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Black sea bass "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
