<p>Condition information comes from <a href="https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition/blob/master/data/allfh.RData">diet data</a>; only regions and seasons with more than 10 fish observations were considered. We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was <a href="https://github.com/Laurels1/Condition/tree/master/data">previously calculated</a>.</p>

Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1.2</span> Condition factor: Weight-volume</h4>
If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.
