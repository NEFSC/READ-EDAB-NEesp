Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 2.2 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 2.3 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 4.2.1 Figures 4.2.1.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 4.5: Witch flounder 4.2.1.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

(#fig:laurel_cond_data)Witch flounder 4.3 Diet Diet data were compiled from existing data. For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 4.3.1 Figure Figure 4.7: Witch flounder 4.3.2 Summary Prey category Season Region Mean proportion +- SD (n years) Range ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL all 0.181 +- 0.088 () 0.028 - 0.356 ANIMAL_REMAINS FALL Outside stock area 0.204 +- 0.122 () 0.044 - 0.49 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING all 0.144 +- 0.074 () 0.008 - 0.318 ANIMAL_REMAINS SPRING Outside stock area 0.116 +- 0.069 () 0.026 - 0.279 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER all 0.355 +- 0.48 () 0.016 - 0.694 ANIMAL_REMAINS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.024 +- NA () 0.024 - 0.024 ANIMAL_REMAINS WINTER Outside stock area 0.126 +- 0.051 () 0.042 - 0.2 ANNELIDA FALL all 0.672 +- 0.112 () 0.445 - 0.865 ANNELIDA FALL Outside stock area 0.574 +- 0.153 () 0.239 - 0.797 ANNELIDA SPRING all 0.712 +- 0.072 () 0.557 - 0.842 ANNELIDA SPRING Outside stock area 0.702 +- 0.146 () 0.386 - 0.95 ANNELIDA SUMMER all 0.575 +- 0.477 () 0.238 - 0.913 ANNELIDA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.436 +- NA () 0.436 - 0.436 ANNELIDA WINTER Outside stock area 0.781 +- 0.062 () 0.703 - 0.864 ARTHROPODA FALL all 0.069 +- 0.059 () 0.006 - 0.257 ARTHROPODA FALL Outside stock area 0.139 +- 0.131 () 0.046 - 0.501 ARTHROPODA SPRING all 0.044 +- 0.023 () 0.009 - 0.093 ARTHROPODA SPRING Outside stock area 0.072 +- 0.066 () 0.014 - 0.288 ARTHROPODA SUMMER all 0.042 +- NA () 0.042 - 0.042 ARTHROPODA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.352 +- NA () 0.352 - 0.352 ARTHROPODA WINTER Outside stock area 0.048 +- 0.031 () 0.006 - 0.095 CNIDARIA FALL all 0.009 +- 0.006 () 0.002 - 0.018 CNIDARIA FALL Outside stock area 0.001 +- 0.001 () 0.001 - 0.002 CNIDARIA SPRING all 0.028 +- 0.02 () 0.005 - 0.072 CNIDARIA SPRING Outside stock area 0.042 +- 0.046 () 0 - 0.127 CNIDARIA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.171 +- NA () 0.171 - 0.171 CNIDARIA WINTER Outside stock area 0.005 +- 0.005 () 0.002 - 0.011 ECHINODERMATA FALL all 0.031 +- 0.041 () 0.001 - 0.169 ECHINODERMATA FALL Outside stock area 0.042 +- 0.044 () 0.016 - 0.108 ECHINODERMATA SPRING all 0.049 +- 0.077 () 0.001 - 0.272 ECHINODERMATA SPRING Outside stock area 0.089 +- 0.124 () 0 - 0.276 ECHINODERMATA SUMMER Outside stock area 0 +- NA () 0 - 0 ECHINODERMATA WINTER Outside stock area 0.026 +- 0.027 () 0.008 - 0.067 FISH FALL all 0.023 +- 0.033 () 0.003 - 0.081 FISH FALL Outside stock area 0.013 +- 0.011 () 0.005 - 0.02 FISH SPRING all 0.005 +- 0.008 () 0 - 0.018 FISH SPRING Outside stock area 0.006 +- 0.007 () 0.001 - 0.011 FISH SUMMER Outside stock area 0 +- NA () 0 - 0 FISH WINTER Outside stock area 0.006 +- 0.007 () 0.002 - 0.011 MISCELLANEOUS FALL all 0.018 +- 0.02 () 0 - 0.062 MISCELLANEOUS FALL Outside stock area 0.026 +- 0.033 () 0.002 - 0.081 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING all 0.021 +- 0.024 () 0 - 0.085 MISCELLANEOUS SPRING Outside stock area 0.017 +- 0.03 () 0 - 0.107 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER all 0.001 +- NA () 0.001 - 0.001 MISCELLANEOUS SUMMER Outside stock area 0.007 +- NA () 0.007 - 0.007 MISCELLANEOUS WINTER Outside stock area 0.036 +- 0.044 () 0 - 0.085 MOLLUSCA FALL all 0.018 +- 0.012 () 0 - 0.043 MOLLUSCA FALL Outside stock area 0.046 +- 0.049 () 0.001 - 0.132 MOLLUSCA SPRING all 0.014 +- 0.011 () 0.001 - 0.036 MOLLUSCA SPRING Outside stock area 0.036 +- 0.074 () 0 - 0.322 MOLLUSCA SUMMER all 0.068 +- NA () 0.068 - 0.068 MOLLUSCA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.005 +- NA () 0.005 - 0.005 MOLLUSCA WINTER Outside stock area 0.014 +- 0.015 () 0.001 - 0.036 OTHER FALL all 0.026 +- 0.038 () 0.001 - 0.111 OTHER SPRING all 0.02 +- 0.028 () 0.001 - 0.099 OTHER SPRING Outside stock area 0.02 +- 0.016 () 0.001 - 0.045 OTHER WINTER Outside stock area 0.012 +- 0.014 () 0.001 - 0.022 UROCHORDATA FALL all 0.017 +- 0.018 () 0.003 - 0.053 UROCHORDATA FALL Outside stock area 0.017 +- 0.013 () 0.001 - 0.034 UROCHORDATA SPRING all 0.008 +- 0.006 () 0.002 - 0.018 UROCHORDATA SPRING Outside stock area 0.015 +- 0.014 () 0.002 - 0.03 UROCHORDATA SUMMER all 0.029 +- NA () 0.029 - 0.029 UROCHORDATA SUMMER Outside stock area 0.004 +- NA () 0.004 - 0.004 WORMS FALL all 0.004 +- 0.003 () 0.001 - 0.006 WORMS FALL Outside stock area 0.027 +- 0.034 () 0.002 - 0.066 WORMS SPRING all 0.006 +- 0.011 () 0.001 - 0.026 WORMS SPRING Outside stock area 0.01 +- 0.012 () 0 - 0.029 4.3.3 Data (#fig:diet_data)Witch flounder "],["population-information.html", "Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance 5.2 Biomass 5.3 B/Bmsy 5.4 Recruitment", " Section 5 Population information 5.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 5.1.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.
